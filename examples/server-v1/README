This is a simple server.

It support dynamic change of functionnality (echo, uppercase-echo or
lowercase-echo) and dynamic change of debugging verbosity (full or none). It
uses localhost for connections.

This is only a small experiment to test the feasability of FRP based dynamic
reconfiguration.

The version 1 is built using the helper functions in the library (but no magic
beyond that).
